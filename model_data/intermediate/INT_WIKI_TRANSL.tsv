1	1	Particle physics is the study of quarks and their interactions in the formation of particles. What are the basic properties of particles? What are the basic interactions? What are the rules of interaction? Modern particle physics includes more comprehensive theories, including quantum mechanics, relativity, field theory, etc. ... as well as the latest explorations and developments of space and cosmology.
2	2	"When it comes to theoretical physics and experimental physics

Physics, in particular, has a special challenge that is probably the most difficult among the eight sciences. Since the 20th century onwards, physics can silently challenge theoretical physics and experimental physics."
3	3	Neuralink Corporation is a neurotechnology company that develops implantable brain–machine interface (BCI) technology. Headquartered in California, it was co-founded by Elon Musk and seven other scientists and engineers. Neuralink was established in 2016, and first publicly announced in March 2017.
4	4	Since the company's inception, it has recruited several high-profile neuroscientists from various universities. By July 2019, the company had received $158 million in funding, of which $100 million came from Musk and employed around 90 employees. At the same time, Neuralink has taken on the extremely ambitious task of developing "sewing machine-like" technology that can routinely implant thousands of electrodes in a subject's brain, which theoretically could allow humans to merge with artificial intelligence, and is a type of experimental surgical procedure used to treat serious neurological conditions like chronic seizures by embedding up to 1,500 electrodes. Neuralink also expects to start human trials in 2020, and to implant a functional device in paraplegic individuals as early as 2023.
5	5	A neuroscience researcher and various MIT technology reviewers critically commented on Musk's Neuralink presentation, saying that certain scientific claims were "highly speculative".
6	6	"Company
History
Neuralink was established in 2016 by Elon Musk and a team of seven scientists and engineers. The founding team includes experts in neuroscience, electronics, and robotics, among other fields. The "Neuralink" trademark was initially registered by Musk's name in January 2017 and was not disclosed until later."
7	7	In April 2017, Neuralink announced that the purpose of the company is to integrate artificial intelligence into the human brain to prevent being overtaken by artificial intelligence in the future. Musk suggested, he was inspired by Iain M. Banks's "Culture" series of 10 books to address the potential for "neural laces" to merge humans with artificial intelligence.
8	8	Musk considers the integration of AI into the human brain as a critical step to "avoid becoming pets or dinosaurs", in regard to the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Without such integration, Musk fears that humans will be fundamentally left behind in the face of AI's development. Musk argued that the company's initial goal is to assist those with severe brain injuries. He is concerned if there is no movement towards this direction, artificial intelligence will likely advance in a way that overwhelms human capabilities. Musk believes that this technology will offer a "layer of cortical interface that would love and understand you" and "improve the neural link between your brain and your digital self, allowing humans to better keep up with AI".
9	9	World War II, which happened from 1939 to 1945, was a global war involving many of the world's countries, and it is the most widespread war in history, with the greatest number of casualties and the broadest destruction. During that time, more than 70 nations were involved. It resulted in significant casualties, with an estimated death toll of more than 60 million people. The Allies won the war.
10	10	In the context of World War II, the Japanese military operations are also called the Pacific War; Japanese battles in Southeast Asia are referred to as the Southeast Asian War.
11	11	The rule of law is a principle that all countries use to allow people to understand their rights within a certain system. Constitutional and legal processes, as well as people involved in the rule of law, are subjected to the same criticism and investigations. In most modern societies, the rule of law is seen as a higher ethical standard, dictating people's actions, thoughts and relationships. In most contemporary societies nowadays, the rule of law is an important mechanism to balance power and to regulate the most fair and transparent conflicts.
12	12	The foundation of the rule of law is essentially the rule of law itself, its applications encompass constitution, legislation, and civil rights. Legislation is a tool designed to enable and facilitate social harmony.
13	13	Constitutional processes put the rule of law into practice, allowing an environment in which everyone can exercise their rights within a legal context, often referred to as "legal land". These rights are usually manifest in written law. Legal land can protect the weak, but also uphold the public interest. As far back as 350 BC, the Greek scholar Aristotle stated: "Better for the state to be governed by laws than by humans."
14	14	Literature is often seen as a precursor to the rule of law, closely associated with moral standards, and related to the discussion of fairness, all of which will reflect the spirit of the rule of law. Additionally, in some countries, religious texts including Vedas, Bible or the Quran can also be seen as sources containing legal concepts.
15	15	"The essence of the rule of law
Common law and civil law
Common law is a legal system used in many large countries, it is a principle of law that emphasizes the demonstration of justice, or the spirit of the law, to resolve disputes. Common law also has a principle, which is the legal precedent. In countries that use common law, law firms have a relatively small role, the main part of the law and its interpretation is often decided by the judiciary."
16	16	Civil law is a system that uses written laws as the main method to resolve disputes. Its origin is in England, but it is also widely used in most European countries and developed countries. It is also the most common legal system in the United States, although the US government has jurisdictions of common law, but the more common legal spirit is due to the use of written law.
17	17	Civil law also exists in China, its earliest inception was when John Cockburn introduced it to Taiwan during the colonial period.
18	18	"Religious law
Religious law is legal processing based on religious doctrine or religious law. Examples include Jewish Halakha, Islamic Sharia, and Christian Canon Law. Until the 18th century, Sharia was a predominant legal system in the Islamic world. In countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, their legal systems are fundamentally based on Sharia."
19	19	Religious law from a specific religion usually has very strict norms, and often has more restrictions from certain perspectives and fields.
20	20	Human rights, strictly speaking, are what we have from birth, they are inherent rights. According to the Universal Declaration, human rights are something that every person has, and they cannot be taken away under any circumstances. Therefore, people who violate this principle, because of their negligence and disregard for human values, are the essence of disgrace.
21	21	We are saying that there is a right that cannot be compromised, that is our inherent dignity. Therefore, no one can take this right away, take it as a bargain, use it to threaten someone or exchange it. It is not something that anyone can manipulate, and nobody can violate it. In other words, a person should not be treated as a tool by others, because nobody has the right to do so, especially not him/her.
22	22	If we talk about the essence of human rights, it's a very broad concept. That is, there are various aspects of human rights, and every aspect of human rights is interconnected and inseparable from each other. Any attempt to violate or infringe upon any one of these rights is unacceptable. Not to mention that there is no consensus on this topic, however, because any existing human rights cannot be violated. This leads to endless debates and discussions on this complex and holistic subject.
23	23	In fact, having rights, in an ideal sense, is sacred and inviolable. These include the right to life, freedom of speech, the right not to be treated as a tool, the right not to be harmed, and the right to privacy.
24	24	Universal Declaration of Human Rights
25	25	The United Nations enacted the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" in 1948. This is a manifesto on human rights, recognizing each and every nation and individual's right to freedom and respect, guiding various aspects of life and stressing the interconnectedness and interdependence of these rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights highlights a key point:
26	26	that the human rights in international law are absolutely fundamental, unassailable, and inherently present from birth.
27	27	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights emphasizes the responsibilities of nations, including the duty to protect the fundamental rights of citizens (such as civil and political rights, as well as other rights).
28	28	The basic idea of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is divided into two fundamental principles that complement and balance each other:
29	29	The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was opened for signature in 1966 and came into force on March 23, 1976.
30	30	Similarly, The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was opened for signature in 1966 and came into force on January 3, 1976.
31	31	Other important human rights covenants include:
32	32	The Convention relating to the Status of Refugees entered into force in 1951.
33	33	The Convention Against Torture entered into force in 1984.
34	34	The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination came into force in 1969.
35	35	The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women came into force in 1981.
36	36	The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child came into force in 1989.
37	37	The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court came into force in 2002.
38	38	Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (April 15, 1452 - May 2, 1519) was a giant in the Italian Renaissance period. He was a scientist, architect, engineer, sculptor, inventor, military engineer, musician, and artist. In particular, his tremendous achievements in art earned him the title of "Renaissance Man". Considered a polymath, he was an individual deeply interested and skilled in multiple disciplines. He is often said to be one of the greatest painters in world history.
39	39	Buddhism is the 3rd largest religion in the world, after Christianity and Islam. Originating in the 6th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama founded Buddhism in India, which is known as the era of enlightenment. Depending on the tradition and interpretation, Buddhism can be divided into Northern Buddhism and Southern Buddhism, and according to some classifications, it can be further divided into Lesser Vehicle Buddhism and Greater Vehicle Buddhism. At present, Buddhism is popular in China, Korea, Japan and many other Asian countries, as well as in some Western countries.
40	40	Buddhist scriptures
41	41	A Quick Guide to Buddhist scriptures
42	42	Since the time of Siddhartha Gautama, Buddhism has been deeply intertwined with Indian society, even up until the time of Emperor Ashoka. Buddhism has already become the religion of India, influencing generations of believers. Furthermore, the compilation of Buddhist texts began quite early. From the 150-year-aged Ajanta Caves, we can trace the spread of Buddhism to all seven continents of the world.
43	43	Despite the spread of Buddhism, it was not completely accepted and integrated into the teachings and practices of Siddhartha Gautama, up until it became an 18-fold sect. For a period of time, it birthed the Greater Vehicle Buddhism.
44	44	According to Emperor Ashoka, Buddhism was divided into two unrelated sects. Southern Buddhism was spread to Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Sri Lanka. Northern Buddhism is further divided into two branches. One branch, known from the Kashyapa Matanga, was spread to Xinjiang, then during the Han Dynasty it entered China, developing into Han Buddhism, and later also spread to Korea, Japan and Vietnam. The other branch already in the Northwestern regions, was known as Central Buddhism, or Lamaism.
45	45	Basic precepts
46	46	Buddhists should adhere to the basic precepts in their daily lives. Although these are not absolutely immutable, they generally don’t change. The basic precepts of Buddhism are "no killing, no stealing, no lying, no drinking".
47	47	"No killing" is a corner stone of Buddhism, as the seven types of killing are accounted to: "killing parents", "killing elders", "killing Brahmins" (Hindu scholars), "killing kings", "harming the body", "creating schism", "shedding the Buddha's blood". These are the most serious crimes, and one need to understand the root causes in order to avoid committing them.
48	48	"No stealing" refers to the prohibition of theft, which should be understood as taking what is not given, not just theft in the legal sense, but also in the broader ethical context. This also includes plagiarism.
49	49	"No lying" fundamentally indicates the need to maintain honesty. It means that deception must be avoided.
50	50	"No drinking" refers to the avoidance of intoxication and confusion, suggesting that one should adopt a sober lifestyle to achieve a clear mind and effectively prevent misconduct, false speech, theft, and other misconduct and negligence.
51	51	Buddhism encourages people to be tolerant, quiet and peaceful, and to have a kind heart. Buddhism advocates mutual respect and equality, as it helps people truly understand and realize the teachings of Buddhism.
52	52	Siddhartha Gautama sought the answer to many questions in order to help people reach enlightenment. Once, he meditated under the Bodhi tree for seven days and nights, after which he came up with a theory: one must understand the causes of suffering in order to alleviate pain and achieve eternal happiness, understanding the true meaning of life, the nature of existence, and how karma works.
53	53	The principles and precepts of Buddhism are widely respected and followed in countries where Buddhism has spread.
54	54	Lesser Vehicle Buddhism explains the earliest teachings of Buddhism, as Siddhartha Gautama was a deeply enlightened man, not a god, but also an ordinary man who understands the meaning of life. Ordinary people, if they want to understand the teachings of Buddhism, must leave their family and join the monastery for a period of time to truly understand and eventually achieve the state of an Arhat. Lesser Vehicle Buddhism emphasizes self-enlightenment, which means self-awakening to the truth of the world, also known as self-liberation.
55	55	Greater Vehicle Buddhism believes that everyone can become a Buddha, and everyone can attain enlightenment and save all beings in the world, that is, achieve Buddhahood. Greater Vehicle Buddhism emphasizes attaining Buddhahood, which means you don't necessarily have to leave your family, as long as you have Buddha in your heart, and you can still achieve Buddhahood under any circumstances.
56	56	Today's technology is different from that of the past, especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the English language literature. Cognitive science, psychology, and computer science all have contributed to AI, contributing to its learning, its intelligence, and its ability to complete a variety of tasks. The future will heavily rely on cognitive science for developing AI.
57	57	"Culture
Today's technology is largely reflected in science fiction, particularly in Cyberpunk."
58	58	The iPhone is a mobile phone series developed by Apple Inc and runs the iOS mobile software developed by the same company. The first iPhone was announced on January 9, 2007, by then-CEO of Apple Inc., Steve Jobs, and was officially released on June 29 of the same year. On September 9, 2015, Apple Inc. held a new product release conference in Cupertino, USA, and announced the new product iPhone 6S, which was officially released on September 25 of the same year. The iPhone series developed by Apple Inc., due to its unique design and excellent performance, is considered one of the largest high-end mobile phone brands.
59	59	The use of the iPhone has significantly changed the foundation of cell phone technology and has also brought about a wide range of innovations. It is a mobile device that integrates sophisticated technology, touch operation, rich applications, easy-to-use interactive interface, comfortable design and other characteristics. iPhone is a high-end mobile phone that supports a variety of communication methods, including Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G and LTE connectivity; the more advanced version even allows VPN connection, which makes it convenient for various learning and work applications. It is also capable of texting, taking photos, interactive animation calls, and various applications. The added phone functions, such as instant messaging, GPS navigation, and data synchronization across devices, allow users to understand the current situation and information in real-time, making it a highly intelligent, modern device.
60	60	Michael Joseph Jackson is an American singer and dancer, a white American, born in Indiana, USA.
61	61	Jackson began performing as part of The Jackson 5 at the age of 11 and started his solo career in 1971. His albums Off the Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, and HIStory, have all set world records.
62	62	He is known as the "King of Pop", and has received 13 Grammy Awards and topped 13 singles charts.
63	63	Biography
64	64	Michael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana. He is the eighth of ten children of the Jackson family. His family is known as a poor working-class African American family. Michael's mother, Katherine Esther Scruse, was a devout Jehovah's Witness, while his father, Joseph Walter Jackson, was a former boxer, a worker at U.S. Steel company, and would also occasionally perform in a local band, The Falcons.
65	65	Hokkien, also known as Minnan, is a major branch of the Southern Min group of Chinese languages. It is widely spoken and can be heard throughout Fujian province, the Chaoshan and Leizhou regions of Guangdong, Taiwan, the Hainan island, and by the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia, including the Pearl River Delta, Singapore, and Malaysia. This language is also prevalent in the southern part of Fujian province along the coastal cities and towns as well as in certain districts of eastern Guangdong. Furthermore, Hokkien is also used in other parts of the world where there's a substantial number of Chinese community.
66	66	When people usually say "Hokkien", it usually refers to the language spoken in the Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and Haixi regions of Fujian province as well as in Taiwan.
67	67	In the Chinese Mainland context, Hokkien language is often referred to as Minnan. In Southeast Asia, it is typically called "Hokkien", whereas in Taiwan, it's referred to as "Hoklo language", "Taiwanese language", or "Taiwanese". It's also known as such in Hong Kong.
68	68	The origin of Hokkien language is generally traced back to the Fujian province in China, specifically to the cities of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and Xiamen.
69	69	Xiamen dialect and Taiwanese dialect are often considered to be the standard variants of Hokkien. In Hainan, the Hainanese dialect is most commonly used.
70	70	Name
71	71	Traditionally, there is not a single term for this language, especially in terms of dialects, the name varies from place to place. Currently, in Fujian, people usually refer to it as "Hokkien language/Hokkien", though some people among themselves would refer to it as "our language". In Southeast Asia, it is most commonly known as Hokkien, except in the Philippines where it's also referred to as "our language". In Taiwan, the terminology is more diverse, with "Taiwanese", "Hoklo language", and "Hokkien" being the main terms used. Meanwhile, it is also sometimes called "our language".
72	72	In Taiwan, some people insist on calling it Taiwanese not Hokkien. This is because they believe that the current Taiwanese language and the Hokkien language in Fujian are two different languages with no little similarities. One main point of this viewpoint is:
73	73	The Taiwanese language has absorbed many elements from other languages, particularly Japanese vocabulary.
74	74	Hokkien language was introduced to Taiwan hundreds of years ago. Taiwanese language has since evolved and has differences from the Hokkien language spoken in Fujian.
75	75	This is also due to the historical context of Taiwan's independence movement, directed towards the mainstream ideology that pushes for self-determination, insisting on calling Taiwan as Taiwan and China as China; recognizing Taiwan as Taiwan, differentiating it from China.
76	76	The sound system of Hokkien
77	77	Pronunciation
78	78	The pronunciation of Hokkien closely follows the sound system of Old Chinese, implying that Hokkien has preserved many aspects of the pronunciation of Middle Chinese that have been lost in other Chinese languages. Nowadays, it is usually believed that Old Chinese had 19 initial consonants. According to the traditional analysis of Hokkien, there are 18, but only 15 of them are present in modern Hokkien, even though it still has more than modern Mandarin's 15.
79	79	One point about Old Chinese:
80	80	Hokkien is more fashionable and better at preserving the pronunciation of Old Chinese than Mandarin Chinese, because it can be more accurately analyzed by comparing it with the phonetic points of Old Chinese, one by one.
81	81	In Hokkien, nasal and non-nasal sounds are carefully differentiated, for instance, the character "飛", "蓬", "吠", and "微" are pronounced distinctly.
82	82	Retroflex sounds in Hokkien are closer to those in Old Chinese, such as in the pronunciation of the characters "豬", "醜", and "程".
83	83	Hokkien pronounces many aspirated consonants just like in Old Chinese, such as in the pronunciation of the characters "唇", "振", "召", and "注".
84	84	Vowels and tones
85	85	Hokkien's vowels and tones clearly reveal points of Old Chinese pronunciation. Regarding vowels, Hokkien generally retains six vowel sounds of Old Chinese, and among them, four major ones can be classified as central vowels or peripheral vowels.
86	86	Regarding tones, the tone categories of Old Chinese of "level, rising, departing, entering" have generally been clearly reflected in Hokkien. The Zhangzhou dialect has seven tones: "dark level, dark rising, dark departing, dark entering, rising level, rising departing, rising entering", while the Qunazhou dialect has an additional rising-rising tone.
87	87	Vocabulary
88	88	The vocabulary of Hokkien has many similarities with the one of Old Chinese, and it's easier to trace back to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, like the saying "Chat every day, dig deep every day", where "dig" refers to the language of that period. For instance, "In the beginning of the dynasty, clothes were not woven, and everyone knew how to weave." Words like "three corners", "cold-mouthed", "morning-stamped", "average", "round cloth", "wide bowl" are all vocabulary from the Tang and Song Dynasty period.
89	89	A unique feature of Hokkien vocabulary is its similarity to the modern Chinese language, but also its similarity to Old Chinese, such as "grandmother", "very", "chilly", "clear", and "open leg".
90	90	The role of Chinese characters in writing
91	91	In terms of the written language in all Chinese languages, Hokkien is relatively complete. "Writing" means the "spoken script system" or "phonetic notation system". "Literature" stands for "literary language" or "vernacular language". The "phonetic notation system" and "literary language" of Hokkien can be considered two relatively independent systems. The mode of operation of these two systems is a very complete language phenomenon. The written language in Hokkien can be roughly divided into:
92	92	The characteristics of classical Hokkien language
93	93	The vocabulary of Hokkien is mainly derived from classical Chinese and ancient Hokkien language. Currently, Hokkien vocabulary retains more characteristics of ancient Hokkien language, like in the pronunciation of "ka-cháu" (to search), "ka-cho̍ah" (to stir), "ka-lēng" (to freeze), "tō͘-kâu" (to steal), "tō͘-ún" (to steal), "káu-hiā" (to scare), "ka-lún-sún" (to run), "phah-kha-chhiùⁿ" (to touch), "tio̍h-ka-cha̍k" (to hit by mistake).
94	94	Loan Words
95	95	Since the Tang dynasty, Quanzhou began to be known as "the largest port in the East", becoming a starting point of the Maritime Silk Road to the Middle East in Quanzhou. Consequently, Hokkien language absorbed a lot of words from Middle East, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. In addition to that, the exotic cultures introduced many new concepts to Hokkien, which were then integrated into Hokkien, forming part of its vocabulary. Examples include “sat-bûn”, “pa-sat”, “chi-ku-la̍t”, “chu-lu̍t”, “phia̍t-á”, “tōng-kak”, “si̍p-pán-á”, “ba̍k-thâu”, “àu-sài”, “te̍k-sî”, “pa-sū”, “má-tih”, “gō͘-kha-kī”, “ka-po̍k / ka-pò͘-mî”, “ko-pi” and more.
96	96	Taiwanese Hokkien has a large number of foreign vocabulary influences, with the most common ones being from Japanese, such as “o͘-tó͘-bái”, “khí-mo͘-chih”, “chu-ná-mih”, “tò-sàng”, “sa-sí-mih”. Besides these, some words have borrowed from Philippine languages and other foreign languages.
97	97	Tone system
98	98	Every type of language has its own tonal system. However, each language's tonal system is usually complex and difficult to understand. Some languages' tonal systems are more complicated than others, for example, Hokkien.
99	99	Researchers around the world have different opinions on the "phonetic system". Some people tend to view the phonetic system from a linguistic perspective, while others have a different perspective.
100	100	In Taiwan, some language scholars believe that the Hokkien phonetic notation system (commonly known as the ''Pe̍h-ōe-jī'' or POJ) is one of the most logical ones.
101	101	Using the Pe̍h-ōe-jī system for phonetic transcription
102	102	From a linguistic perspective, the Pe̍h-ōe-jī system is more reader-friendly and easier to use as compared to other systems. Moreover, the Pe̍h-ōe-jī system fully reflects the pronunciation, so sometimes Pe̍h-ōe-jī can reveal the correct pronunciation of a character. The Pe̍h-ōe-jī phonetic system is quite similar to the phonetic system of the Roman alphabet.
103	103	Taiwanese Hokkien phonetics
104	104	Taiwanese Hokkien phonetics system can be differentiated into 64 sounds (Yun Un-gian, Tiuⁿ Ha̍k-khiam, 1999), which can be classified into eight groups. Some use the Initials Finals system, some use Kana, and some use Hangeul, but the most common system is the Romanization system. However, there's no universally agreed system as of now. The most convenient and commonly used are the Tai-lo, Pe̍h-ōe-jī (Church Romanization), TLPA and Tongyong Pinyin.
105	105	Comparison
106	106	Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Refer to Pe̍h-ōe-jī for more details.
107	107	TLPA (Taiwanese Phonetic Alphabet, also known as "Tâi-lô")
108	108	On August 17, 1991, the scholars Ang Ui-jin, Tiuⁿ Jū-hong, Táng Tiong-su founded the Taiwanese Language Association. Soon after, based on the phonetic system of Pe̍h-ōe-jī, the Taiwanese Language Association proposed a new Taiwanese Phonetic Alphabet, also known as the "Taiwanese Phonetic Alphabet".
109	109	The rationale for proposing TLPA is:
110	110	(1) The phonetics of Taiwanese is quite complex, vital for the teaching and learning of Taiwanese language.
111	111	(2) Pe̍h-ōe-jī lacks a systematic integration of tones and signs.
112	112	The major difference between TLPA and POJ is:
113	113	TLPA, which has been established for a shorter time, has had a significant influence in Taiwanese Hokkien, particularly in the pronunciation of characters in TLPA and POJ which are quite different and need to be studied separately.
114	114	Common phonetics
115	115	The phonetic notation of Hokkien in Fujian
116	116	In Hokkien, Fujian, the pronunciation is very similar to the characters of the Hokkien Romanized script, commonly known as Pe̍h-ōe-jī. This phenomenon allows for an easier understanding of the Hokkien Romanized script. However, at present in Fujian, while some people still use Hokkien Romanized script, fewer people are learning it.
117	117	The Common Hokkien Romanized System, also known as the Phonemic Ruby Characters: Xiamen University's National Language Research Center in China published a dictionary called "Common Language Hokkien Dialect Dictionary" in 1982. This dictionary uses alphabet notation similar to the International Phonetic Alphabet, hence it's often referred to as the "Common Hokkien Romanized System". This notation primarily serves as reference for scholars in Mainland China's linguistics field.
118	118	However, when it comes to phonetics of Hokkien in mainland China, the phonetic system most commonly used by scholars is the National Phonetic Alphabet.
119	119	Literature and writings
120	120	Early Hokkien literature
121	121	The literature of the early Chinese era often originated from the vulgar language of the Confucian texts, or the variant Chinese characters found in Buddhist texts; they then borrowed the influence of the Tang and Song dynasties to further develop. Until the Ming and Qing dynasties, when the rest of China began to see a rise in vernacular literature, it's often said that the earliest form of Hokkien literature, the Fukien Rhyme-Prose, appeared first in Quanzhou and Chaozhou regions in the Song dynasty. However, to be precise, it wasn't exactly the Hokkien literature as we know it today.
122	122	The earliest types of Hokkien written records can be found in songs, verses, and operas that originated from the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou regions.
123	123	20th Century's Hokkien literature development
124	124	During most of the 20th century, due to Japan's rule in Taiwan and subsequent globalization, the application of the Hokkien language in writing was restricted. However, a group of Taiwan intellectuals strived to resist this trend and attempted to redefine language and literature in Taiwan. This led to some Taiwan natives' preference for using the "most unique and vibrant Taiwanese language to rebuild Taiwan literature." However, because Japanese rule may influence the development of the local language and culture, Mandarin, which is dominant in Taiwan, and other foreign literary languages have suppressed the development of local language literature. During this period, the most notable contributors to local language literature have included Lian Un-kheng, Lian Ngá-tông, N̂g Se̍k-hui, and Keh Chhiu-seng.
125	125	The 1970s Taiwanese Literature Movement
126	126	After the Kuo-Min Tang eased its control after the martial law, the literary circle in Taiwan began to pay attention to Taiwanese literature, and both writers and scholars participated in the "Taiwanese Literature Movement". The related main figures include Lim Gim Hian, Lim Chong Guan, Ng Keng Lian, Lim Yong Bin, Ang Ui Jin, Tan Liong Uei, Tan Beng Jiat, Topas Tam, Goh Siow Leng, Lee Kin Hoat, and so on.
127	127	Writing system of Hokkien
128	128	Hokkien is a branch of the Chinese language. Its writing system is very similar to Modern Chinese Phonetic Notation. The written form is colloquial Hokkien, which is also known as "Hokkien Literature". In Taiwan, it's often referred as "Taiwanese Literature".
129	129	How to write Hokkien Literature? Truthfully, this topic is not fixed and varies from place to place. It's also a more complicated issue in Taiwan. In Taiwan, there are a few different systems for writing in Hokkien:
130	130	Using only Chinese characters, referred to as "full Chinese"
131	131	Using only Romanized script, referred to as "full Roman"
132	132	Using both Chinese characters and Romanized script in different proportions. Depending on the writer's preference and circumstances, this could be loosely categorized as "semi-Chinese" or "semi-Roman".
133	133	Other scripts, such as Chu Nom, Kana, and Hangeul are also used.
134	134	However, currently, the writing system for Taiwanese Hokkien is not standardised and it can be said to be quite diverse, often resulting in a conundrum for people on how to choose a way to write it easily and unambiguously. Nevertheless, since the 1990s, a consensus to mainly use Romanization, particularly Pe̍h-ōe-jī, has gradually formed. The main reason to use Romanized script over Chinese characters or other scripts is that it doesn't have the following disadvantages:
135	135	The most common and universally accepted script for Hokkien is Romanized script;
136	136	Romanized script is a phonetic script, which can accurately reflect and remember pronunciation;
137	137	It contains a wealth of information about the history of the population; however, at present, the term "historical information" in Hokkien Romanized script is not very accurate because Hokkien Romanized script has undergone many changes and not all of them are well documented, plus there are still unresolved issues.
138	138	Using full Romanization can avoid the complexity of Chinese characters.
139	139	There are two main reasons why some people resist using Chinese characters. The first reason is practicality: some people just find Chinese characters to be too hard and complicated to use. The second reason is more ideological. They believe that by refusing to use Chinese characters, Taiwan can culturally distinguish itself from China more completely.
140	140	In summary, the writing system of Taiwanese Hokkien literature, the most characteristic ways include:
141	141	(1) Using purely Romanized script or a mix of Chinese characters and Romanized script, for example, in the Taiwanese Literature Compass, Taiwanese Daily, etc.
142	142	On the other hand, examples like the Hokkien Wikipedia and its sister projects are completely in POJ (Pe̍h-ōe-jī).
143	143	However, writing in full Romanization or semi-Romanization presents an obvious drawback: it will make Hokkien text incomprehensible to those who are only familiar with Chinese characters, which is a major challenge for promoting the reading of such literature.
