At the same time, Neuralink has taken on the extremely ambitious task of developing "sewing machine-like" technology that can routinely implant thousands of electrodes in a subject's brain, which theoretically could allow humans to merge with artificial intelligence, and is a type of experimental surgical procedure used to treat serious neurological conditions like chronic seizures by embedding up to 1,500 electrodes. Neuralink also expects to start human trials in 2020, and to implant a functional device in paraplegic individuals as early as 2023.			Not original

Musk considers the integration of AI into the human brain as a critical step to "avoid becoming pets or dinosaurs", in regard to the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Without such integration, Musk fears that humans will be fundamentally left behind in the face of AI's development. Musk argued that the company's initial goal is to assist those with severe brain injuries. He is concerned if there is no movement towards this direction, artificial intelligence will likely advance in a way that overwhelms human capabilities. Musk believes that this technology will offer a "layer of cortical interface that would love and understand you" and "improve the neural link between your brain and your digital self, allowing humans to better keep up with AI".

Buddhism is the 3rd largest religion in the world, after Christianity and Islam. Originating in the 6th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama founded Buddhism in India, which is known as the era of enlightenment. Depending on the tradition and interpretation, Buddhism can be divided into Northern Buddhism and Southern Buddhism, and according to some classifications, it can be further divided into Lesser Vehicle Buddhism and Greater Vehicle Buddhism. At present, Buddhism is popular in China, Korea, Japan and many other Asian countries, as well as in some Western countries.			Not original

The pronunciation of Hokkien closely follows the sound system of Old Chinese, implying that Hokkien has preserved many aspects of the pronunciation of Middle Chinese that have been lost in other Chinese languages. Nowadays, it is usually believed that Old Chinese had 19 initial consonants. According to the traditional analysis of Hokkien, there are 18, but only 15 of them are present in modern Hokkien, even though it still has more than modern Mandarin's 15.			Not original

The vocabulary of Hokkien has many similarities with the one of Old Chinese, and it's easier to trace back to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, like the saying "Chat every day, dig deep every day", where "dig" refers to the language of that period. For instance, "In the beginning of the dynasty, clothes were not woven, and everyone knew how to weave." Words like "three corners", "cold-mouthed", "morning-stamped", "average", "round cloth", "wide bowl" are all vocabulary from the Tang and Song Dynasty period.			Not original

During most of the 20th century, due to Japan's rule in Taiwan and subsequent globalization, the application of the Hokkien language in writing was restricted. However, a group of Taiwan intellectuals strived to resist this trend and attempted to redefine language and literature in Taiwan. This led to some Taiwan natives' preference for using the "most unique and vibrant Taiwanese language to rebuild Taiwan literature." However, because Japanese rule may influence the development of the local language and culture, Mandarin, which is dominant in Taiwan, and other foreign literary languages have suppressed the development of local language literature. During this period, the most notable contributors to local language literature have included Lian Un-kheng, Lian Ngá-tông, N̂g Se̍k-hui, and Keh Chhiu-seng.			Not original

Nevertheless, since the 1990s, a consensus to mainly use Romanization, particularly Pe̍h-ōe-jī, has gradually formed. The main reason to use Romanized script over Chinese characters or other scripts is that it doesn't have the following disadvantages:			Not original

There are two main reasons why some people resist using Chinese characters. The first reason is practicality: some people just find Chinese characters to be too hard and complicated to use. The second reason is more ideological. They believe that by refusing to use Chinese characters, Taiwan can culturally distinguish itself from China more completely.			Not original
